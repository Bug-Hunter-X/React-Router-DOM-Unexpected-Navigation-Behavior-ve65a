# React Router DOM Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with React Router DOM v6 where navigation does not function as expected after a specific action within a component.  The navigation may fail silently, resulting in no URL change, or may lead to an unexpected route being displayed. 

The bug is related to state management and how component updates interact with React Router's navigation functions. The solution involves careful management of state updates and using `useNavigate` hook properly.
